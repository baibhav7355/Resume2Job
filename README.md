**AI Resume Agent - Quick Local Setup**
This guide provides the steps to get the application running on your local machine for development and testing.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (v18.x or higher)

npm (usually comes with Node.js)

Git

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the project:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2. Install Dependencies
Install all the necessary npm packages for both the server and the client from the root directory:

Bash

npm install
3. Set Up Environment Variables
The project requires API keys to connect to external services.

First, create a .env file by copying the example file:

Bash

cp .env.example .env
Next, open the newly created .env file in a text editor and add your secret API keys:

# .env

2. Sign up (or log in) to [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com).  
3. Choose the **Free Plan**.  
4. After subscribing, you’ll find your API key in the **Endpoints / Code Snippets** section.  
5. Use that key in your project (by setting it in your `.env` file).  



## ▶️ Running the Application
